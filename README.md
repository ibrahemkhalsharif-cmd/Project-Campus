# Project-Campus
A social platform designed for university students, unifying them in one digital space instead of being scattered across different groups. It aims to build a complete student community covering academic, cultural, religious, and activity-based aspects, all within a modern, easy-to-use design that ensures a smooth and comfortable experience.
